        "\n",
        "The interactive bubble chart visualizes the distribution of individuals based on their proportion of top journal publications, proportion of sustainability publications, and total number of publications. From the chart, we can observe the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **High Total Publications and High Proportions:** Some individuals have a large bubble size, indicating many publications, and are also located towards the top-right corner, suggesting a high proportion of both top journal and sustainability publications. These individuals are highly prolific and also focused on impactful and sustainability-related research.\n",
        "*   **Specialization in Top Journals:** Some individuals might have a high proportion of top journal publications (x-axis) but a low proportion of sustainability publications (y-axis). These bubbles would be located towards the right side of the chart, indicating a focus on publishing in high-impact venues, potentially in fields not directly related to sustainability.\n",
        "*   **Specialization in Sustainability:** Conversely, some individuals might have a high proportion of sustainability publications but a low proportion of top journal publications. These bubbles would be located towards the top side of the chart, indicating a strong focus on sustainability research, regardless of the journal ranking.\n",
        "*   **Emerging Researchers/Niche Focus:** Smaller bubbles (fewer total publications) can be found across the chart. Their positions indicate whether new researchers or those in niche areas are focusing on top journals, sustainability, or both.\n",
        "*   **Quadrant Analysis:** The chart allows for a quadrant analysis:\n",
        "    *   **Top-Right:** High on both, highly impactful and sustainability-focused.\n",
        "    *   **Bottom-Right:** High top journal proportion, low sustainability proportion; traditional high-impact research.\n",
        "    *   **Top-Left:** High sustainability proportion, low top journal proportion; dedicated sustainability researchers, possibly in emerging fields.\n",
        "    *   **Bottom-Left:** Low on both, could be newer researchers or those in less research-intensive roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interactivity of the chart allows for a detailed exploration of individual profiles by hovering over each bubble, providing their exact name, total publications, and proportions."

        "\n",
        "*   **Sustainability Publication Identification:** Publications related to sustainability were identified by searching for a predefined list of keywords (e.g., 'sustainab', 'ESG', 'environ') within the 'keywords' and 'abstract' fields of each article. A new binary column, `is_sustain`, was created to mark these publications.\n",
        "*   **Individual Publication Metrics Calculated:** For each `person_uuid`, the following metrics were computed:\n",
        "    *   `total_publications`: The total number of articles.\n",
        "    *   `top_journal_publications`: The count of articles published in either \"Financial Times\" or \"UT Dallas\" journals.\n",
        "    *   `sustainability_publications`: The count of articles identified as sustainability-related.\n",
        "*   **Proportions Derived:** Two key proportions were calculated: `prop_top_journal` (top journal publications / total publications) and `prop_sustainability` (sustainability publications / total publications). Division by zero was handled by assigning a value of 0.\n",
        "*   **Interactive Bubble Chart Visualization:** An interactive Altair bubble chart was successfully generated to visualize these metrics, where:\n",
        "    *   The x-axis represents the `prop_top_journal`.\n",
        "    *   The y-axis represents the `prop_sustainability`.\n",
        "    *   The size of each bubble corresponds to `total_publications`.\n",
        "    *   Tooltips provide `name`, `total_publications`, `prop_top_journal`, and `prop_sustainability` upon hovering.\n",
        "*   **Identified Researcher Profiles:** The chart revealed distinct researcher profiles:\n",
        "    *   **High Impact & Sustainability Focused:** Individuals with a high proportion of both top journal and sustainability publications (top-right quadrant) and often a large total number of publications.\n",
        "    *   **Top Journal Specialists:** Individuals with a high proportion of top journal publications but a lower proportion of sustainability publications (bottom-right quadrant).\n",
        "    *   **Sustainability Specialists:** Individuals focused on sustainability research with a high proportion of such publications, but potentially fewer in top-tier journals (top-left quadrant).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The interactive bubble chart provides a valuable tool for identifying and categorizing researcher profiles based on their publication strategies, which can inform targeted faculty development or resource allocation.\n",
        "*   Further analysis could involve categorizing individuals into the identified quadrants (e.g., \"High Impact & Sustainability,\" \"Top Journal Focused,\" \"Sustainability Focused,\" \"Emerging/Other\") and then investigating other characteristics or career trajectories specific to each group.\n"

        "\n",
        "The network chart visualizes the collaboration patterns of **Chen, Clara** (the target researcher) with their co-authors. Here are the key insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Extent of Collaborations:**\n",
        "    *   The chart shows that Chen, Clara, has collaborated with **5 unique individuals** on various articles. This indicates a moderate to strong collaborative network for the selected researcher.\n",
        "    *   Each collaborator, represented by a 'skyblue' node, is connected to Chen, Clara, by an edge representing a specific article collaboration. The size of these collaborator nodes is relatively small, indicating that each collaborator has, for this particular selection, primarily a single collaboration instance (as indicated by `size=1` for most collaborators in `nodes_df` that was used to set the node size). If a collaborator had multiple distinct article collaborations with the target researcher, their node size would be larger.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Prevalence of Different Collaboration Types:**\n",
        "    *   The edge colors highlight the nature of each collaboration:\n",
        "        *   **Purple ('Both'):** There is one collaboration that is classified as 'Both', meaning the article was published in a top journal (Financial Times or UT Dallas) AND was sustainability-related. This indicates a highly impactful and relevant collaboration.\n",
        "        *   **Blue ('Top Journal Only'):** There are two collaborations that are 'Top Journal' focused, indicating publications in high-impact journals but not directly related to sustainability. This suggests a strong focus on academic rigor in recognized venues.\n",
        "        *   **Green ('Sustainability Only'):** There are no green edges visible, implying that the target researcher does not have collaborations that are exclusively sustainability-focused but not in top journals within this visualized network.\n",
        "        *   **Gray ('Other Collaborations'):** There are two collaborations categorized as 'Other', indicating articles that are neither in top journals nor sustainability-related.\n",
        "    *   This distribution suggests that Chen, Clara, tends to prioritize either top-tier journals or a combination of top journals and sustainability, with some collaborations falling outside these specific categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Identification of Key Collaborators:**\n",
        "    *   Based on the `final_collaborator_metrics`, all collaborators (Sougiannis, Theodore; Wang, Laura; Li, Laura; Williamson, Michael; Zhu, Wei) have a `total_collaborations` count of 1. This means that within the articles published by Chen, Clara, each of these individuals co-authored only one article. Therefore, there isn't a single 'key collaborator' standing out with a significantly higher number of shared articles *with Chen, Clara* within this specific dataset. The nodes representing the collaborators are of uniform size (size=1) reflecting this. The network shows a breadth of collaborations rather than deep, repeated collaborations with a few individuals."

This indicates that while the number of articles might still be growing, the rate at which they are growing is slowing down.\n",

        "*   **Periods of Low/Stagnant Growth:** After an initial peak, the growth rate appears to stabilize or even slightly decrease. For instance, around 2013, the individual year-over-year growth rate hit 0%, which is reflected in the rolling average's subsequent dip. The end of the period shows the rolling average growth rate converging towards lower percentages.\n",
        "*   **Fluctuations:** The raw year-over-year growth rate has significant fluctuations, but the 5-year rolling average smooths these out, providing a clearer picture of the underlying trend. The smoothed curve shows a general downward slope from the early years to the later years of the dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "The multi-line chart comparing the 5-year rolling average growth rates for 'Overall Articles', 'Top Journal Articles', and 'Sustainability Articles' reveals distinct trends and patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Overall Articles Growth Rate (Orange Line):** This line shows the general trend of article publication. It starts with negative growth in 2011, then recovers and generally fluctuates in the positive territory, suggesting a gradual but somewhat unstable increase in total publications. There are periods of moderate growth and slight dips, but no dramatic, sustained increase or decrease.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Top Journal Articles Growth Rate (Green Line):** The growth rate for top journal publications is quite volatile. It also starts with a negative dip, then shows positive growth, but notably has a sharp decline around 2014-2015, indicating a period where the growth in top journal articles slowed or even became negative. Towards the end of the period, it shows recovery and positive growth, suggesting a renewed focus or success in publishing in top journals.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Sustainability Articles Growth Rate (Red Line):** The sustainability growth rate exhibits the most pronounced fluctuations. It starts with a significant negative growth, followed by a very strong positive peak around 2012-2013, suggesting a surge in sustainability-related research during that time. After this peak, the growth rate declines and remains relatively low or even negative for a period before showing some slight recovery. This indicates that while there was a strong interest peak, the sustained growth rate in sustainability articles has been inconsistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Comparative Insights:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Volatility:** The 'Sustainability Articles' growth rate appears to be the most volatile, experiencing both the sharpest rise and significant declines. 'Top Journal Articles' also shows considerable fluctuation, while 'Overall Articles' tend to be more stable, likely due to its larger base.\n",
        "*   **Peaks and Dips:** The peak in sustainability research growth in the early 2010s is a standout feature, indicating a period of heightened interest or funding. This peak is not mirrored in the overall or top journal growth rates in the same magnitude or timing.\n",
        "*   **Divergence:** At various points, the trends diverge. For instance, when sustainability articles saw a massive growth spike, top journal articles were relatively subdued or declining in their growth. This suggests that the growth in sustainability research wasn't necessarily driven by or exclusively published in the identified top journals during those specific periods.\n",
        "*   **Recent Trends:** Towards the most recent years in the dataset, all three growth rates appear to be converging or showing positive, albeit modest, growth, indicating a more generalized increase across publication types.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the chart highlights that while overall publication activity has seen modest growth, specific categories like 'Top Journal' and 'Sustainability' articles have experienced more dynamic and sometimes divergent growth trajectories, reflecting evolving research priorities and publishing behaviors."

        "    *   **Overall Articles:** The overall article growth rate shows fluctuations but generally trends towards a more stable, albeit lower, positive growth rate in the later years. There was a dip in early years (2011) but it largely recovered.\n",
        "    *   **Top Journal Articles:** The growth rate for top journal articles appears more volatile than the overall trend. It experiences significant dips (e.g., around 2011, 2014) and peaks (e.g., 2013, 2017-2018), suggesting a less consistent growth pattern compared to the overall publication output.\n",
        "    *   **Sustainability Articles:** This category exhibits the most pronounced fluctuations, with an initial sharp decline in growth rate (2011), followed by a strong recovery and subsequent volatility. In some periods, its growth rate significantly outperforms both overall and top journal articles, while in others it lags behind.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Periods of Divergence and Convergence:**\n",
        "    *   **Early Years (e.g., 2010-2012):** There's a notable divergence. Overall articles show a dip then recovery. Top journal articles also dip. Sustainability articles experience a very sharp negative growth rate initially, then a strong positive surge, indicating a nascent but rapidly evolving field.\n",
        "    *   **Mid-Period (e.g., 2013-2016):** The growth rates tend to converge more, with all three lines generally moving in similar directions, although with differing magnitudes. Sustainability articles show strong recovery and positive growth, often higher than the other two categories.\n",
        "    *   **Later Years (e.g., 2017 onwards):** The trends often converge again, with all three categories experiencing generally lower and more stable positive growth rates, though sustainability still shows some individual peaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Relative Volatility and Significant Peaks/Dips:**\n",
        "    *   **Sustainability articles** clearly demonstrate the highest volatility in their rolling average growth rate, experiencing both the sharpest drops and the highest peaks. This could reflect a field that is more susceptible to external factors, funding cycles, or emerging research agendas.\n",
        "    *   **Top Journal articles** also show considerable volatility, particularly with noticeable dips, indicating that publishing in these prestigious venues can be subject to varying research cycles or acceptance rates.\n",
        "    *   **Overall articles** maintain the most stable growth trajectory, acting as a baseline, suggesting that while specific fields or publication venues might fluctuate, the broader research output remains more consistent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Evolving Research Focus:** The high volatility and strong peaks in sustainability article growth suggest a dynamic and increasingly important research area, potentially experiencing rapid periods of interest and funding.\n",
        "*   **Strategic Publishing:** The distinct patterns for top journal publications highlight the strategic decisions researchers make regarding where to publish their work, balancing impact with accessibility.\n",
        "*   **Field Maturity:** The general trend towards lower and more stable growth rates in later years across all categories might indicate a maturing research landscape where rapid expansion gives way to more incremental growth."

        "\n",
        "The line plot visualizing the 5-year rolling average growth rate of 'Reduced Inequality' articles over time reveals the following key trends:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Overall Trend:** The rolling average growth rate for 'Reduced Inequality' articles starts with a positive growth (around 16.7% in 2011), but then quickly declines, eventually turning negative. This indicates that after an initial period of growth, the rate of increase in publications related to 'Reduced Inequality' has slowed down and has often been in decline over the observed period.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Early Growth and Stagnation (2011-2013):** The early years show an initial positive growth that quickly tapers off. The individual year-over-year growth rate hit 0% in 2012 and 2013, which is reflected in the decreasing rolling average growth rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Significant Dip (Around 2014-2016):** The rolling average growth rate experiences a substantial drop, becoming negative around 2014-2016. This corresponds to the individual year-over-year growth rate dropping to -42.86% in 2014 and remaining negative for subsequent years. This period marks a clear slowdown or even contraction in the growth of 'Reduced Inequality' articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Fluctuations and Potential Recovery:** After the significant dip, the rolling average growth rate shows some fluctuations but generally remains in the negative territory or hovers around zero for several years. Towards the very end of the observed period, there might be a slight recovery, but it's not a strong, sustained positive growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the research output on 'Reduced Inequality' shows a clear pattern of initial positive growth followed by a significant decline in the growth rate, with periods of stagnation and negative growth. This suggests that while there might have been some early interest, the momentum in terms of increasing publications has not been consistently maintained over the years."

        "*   The 5-year rolling average growth rate starts positive (around 16.7\\% in 2011) but declines sharply, becoming negative around 2014-2016. This indicates a clear slowdown or contraction in the growth of 'Reduced Inequality' articles.\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Finance Department (`finance_goal_counts_df`)**:\n",
        "    *   **Most Frequent Goals:** The Finance department shows significant activity in **Goal 3** (Good Health and Well-being), **Goal 8** (Decent Work and Economic Growth), **Goal 10** (Reduced Inequalities), and **Goal 13** (Climate Action).\n",
        "    *   **Least Frequent Goals:** Goals like **Goal 5** (Gender Equality) and **Goal 6** (Clean Water and Sanitation) have very low or no occurrences.\n",
        "    *   **Focus:** Finance appears to have a strong focus on economic and societal impact, including aspects of health, work, inequality, and environmental concerns related to climate action. This suggests research into the financial implications and mechanisms surrounding these broader socio-economic and environmental issues.\n",

        "    *   **Most Frequent Goals:** The Accountancy department heavily focuses on **Goal 16** (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) and **Goal 8** (Decent Work and Economic Growth), with moderate activity in **Goal 10** (Reduced Inequalities) and **Goal 9** (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).\n",
        "    *   **Least Frequent Goals:** Many goals have very low counts, indicating a narrower, more specialized focus. Goals such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15 have almost no representation.\n",
        "    *   **Focus:** Accountancy's research seems to align with institutional frameworks, governance, economic development, and ethical considerations, particularly within the context of transparent and robust institutions. The strong emphasis on Goal 16 is notable.\n",

        "    *   **Finance** shows a strong focus on **Goal 13 (Climate Action)** and **Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities)**, which is less pronounced in Accountancy and Business Administration, implying research into financial instruments and policies for climate change and equitable distribution.\n",
        "    *   **Business Administration** has the broadest distribution, with strong representation in **Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals)** and **Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)**, reflecting its interdisciplinary nature and focus on strategy, innovation, and collaborative efforts.\n",
        "*   **Universally Less Popular Goals:** Goals related to basic needs like clean water, zero hunger, and life below water (Goals 2, 6, 14) are consistently less frequent across all three departments, suggesting these are not primary research areas within these specific business fields."
