## Projects

### 1. Associated Wholesale Grocers Consulting Project

Data for AWG brand products was used to determine the effectiveness of two programs, AIM Autoship and One Source, in promoting the sales and distribution of new items. The raw data is not included for confidentiality reasons.
- Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

### 2. Consumption and Investment Optimization
- Description: This project involved the use of the JAX machine learning library to optimize consumption and investment ratios for an individual over their lifetime. This includes concepts such as diminishing marginal utility, discounting of future utility, simulation of future stock prices, gradient descent, the sigmoid function, and JIT compilation.
- Tools: Python, NumPy, JAX

### 3. Sustainability Dashboard Case Competition
- Description: This group project involved redesigning a dashboard to showcase the accomplishments made by sustainability researchers in the Gies College of Business. The dashboard was transformed into a storytelling tool with a clearer message, cleaner visuals, and more defined paths for different types of users.
